        <p style="width: 400px; text-align: justify;">The Roman Kingdom, also referred to as the Roman monarchy, or the
            regal period of ancient
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome" target="_blank">Rome</a>, was the
            earliest period of Roman history, when the city and its territory were ruled by kings.

            Little is certain about the kingdom's history, as no records and few inscriptions from the time of the kings
            survive, and the accounts of this period written during the Republic and the Empire are thought to be based
            on oral tradition. According to these legends, the Roman Kingdom began with the city's founding c. 753 BC,
            with settlements around the Palatine Hill along the river Tiber in central Italy, and ended with the
            overthrow of the kings and the establishment of the Republic c. 509 BC.

        <p style="width: 400px; text-align: justify;">The Roman Republic, officially
            the Senate and People
            of Rome, was a state of the classical Roman civilization, run through
            public representation of the Roman people. Beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom (traditionally
            dated to 509 BC) and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire, Rome's control rapidly
            expanded during this period—from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean
            world.

            Roman society under the Republic was primarily a cultural mix of Latin and Etruscan societies, as well as of
            Sabine, Oscan, and Greek cultural elements, which is especially visible in the Roman Pantheon. Its political
            organization developed at around the same time as direct democracy in Ancient Greece, with collective and
            annual magistracies, overseen by a senate.

        <p style="width: 400px; text-align: justify;">The Roman Empire was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome.
            As
            a polity it included
            large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Northern Africa, and Western Asia ruled
            by emperors. From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the 3rd century, it was a
            principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and the city of Rome as sole capital (27 BC – AD 286).
            After the military crisis, the empire was ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman
            Empire and over the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire). Rome remained the nominal
            capital of both parts until AD 476, when the imperial insignia were sent to Constantinople, following the
            capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustulus. The
            adoption of Christianity as the state church of the Roman Empire in AD 380 and the fall of the Western Roman
            Empire to Germanic kings conventionally marks the end of Classical antiquity and the beginning of the Middle
            Ages. Those events, along with the gradual hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire is why historians
            distinguish the medieval Roman Empire that remained in the Eastern provinces as the Byzantine Empire.
